This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Ada programming related to subtype range checks.  The Ada compiler prevents assignments that violate subtype constraints, but this can lead to unexpected behavior if not carefully considered. The `bug.ada` file shows a simple example where an increment operation might seem correct but fails silently due to the subtype constraint.  The `bugSolution.ada` file offers a corrected version.
